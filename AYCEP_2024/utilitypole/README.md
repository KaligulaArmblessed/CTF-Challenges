## utilitypole

One of ROP LLC.'s team members somehow really likes cutting down utility poles. We need to restore the utility poles in Denver to prevent the city council from suing the company, so we have sent some of our operatives to take pictures of utility poles from all over the world. However, they were then forced to undergo VR Training and learn kernel pwn, causing them to forget where they took the pictures! Your task is to identify the country in which each of the pictures was taken. 

The flag format is AYCEP{`flag`}, where `flag` is a lowercase string comprising of the first letters of the countries in which the pictures were taken. For example, if 1.jpg is from Russia, 2.png is from Oman, and 3.png is from Portugal, `flag` equals to `rop`, so you will submit AYCEP{rop}.
